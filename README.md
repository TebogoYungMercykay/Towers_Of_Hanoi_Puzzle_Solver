## Description

- Towers of Hanoi is a popular puzzel game that consists out of two main components: three towers
and n number of disks. The goal of this puzzel game is to move the tower of disks from one tower to
another tower with only moving a single disk at a time. Also a constraint that is placed at all times
on the game is that no disk may be placed on another disk if the bottom disk is smaller then the top
disk.
